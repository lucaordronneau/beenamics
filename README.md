# Beenamics
HoPoMo model

For this project we worked on the HoPoMo model. Bees are essential to pollination and their presence guarantees us better yields for our
farmers. We worked on the article that first appeared in Elsevier's newspaper and then in "ECOLOGICAL MODELLING" in 2007. We
have implemented the equations in Python in order to reproduce the exposed model.
